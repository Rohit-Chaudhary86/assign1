Q1. Flexbox vs. Grid â€” Main Differences
    Feature	 Flexbox	 CSS Grid
Axis	One-dimensional (row or column)	Two-dimensional (row and column)
Control	Good for aligning items along a single axis	Full control over rows and columns layout
Best For	Navbar, buttons group, cards, centering, alignment	Complete page layout, dashboards, image galleries
Parent/Child	Parent defines direction; child items align accordingly	Both parent (grid) and children use grid properties
Learning Curve	Easier, simpler	Slightly more complex but powerful
Example Use	Center a div, navbar, buttons	Complex layouts, pricing sections, forms

 When to use:

Flexbox: For linear layouts (menus, toolbars, cards in one row or column).

Grid: For complex, two-dimensional layouts (pages, pricing tables, galleries).
