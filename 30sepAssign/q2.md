 Difference Between Absolute and Relative Positioning in CSS
✅ Relative Positioning
📌 Positioned relative to its own normal position.

🏗️ Still occupies space in the document flow.

🎯 Used to nudge/move an element slightly from its natural position.

📏 Reference point is its original spot in the layout.

🔧 Common for minor adjustments without breaking the layout.

✅ Absolute Positioning
📌 Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (position: relative, absolute, or fixed).

🏗️ Removed from the document flow, meaning it doesn’t take up space.

🎯 Used to place the element exactly anywhere within the parent or the page.

📏 If no positioned ancestor is found, it positions relative to the viewport (browser window).

🔧 Common for elements like popups, modals, tooltips, overlays, floating buttons.
