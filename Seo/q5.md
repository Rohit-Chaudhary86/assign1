Q5: What is a Favicon?
A Favicon (short for Favorite Icon) is the small icon shown in the browser tab next to the page title. It helps with branding and user recognition.

 Example Code:
html
Copy
Edit
<head>
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
  <title>My Portfolio</title>
</head>
The file favicon.ico should be placed in the same folder as your HTML file.

You can also use .png or .svg as favicons.
