Task 5: Difference between justify-items vs justify-self
 Property	 Works On	 Description
justify-items	Entire container (parent)	Aligns all grid items horizontally within their cells.
justify-self	Individual grid item (child)	Aligns a single item horizontally within its cell.

Code Example:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 100px); gap: 10px; justify-items: center; border: 2px solid;">
  <div style="background: #4caf50; padding: 20px;">1</div>
  <div style="background: #2196f3; padding: 20px; justify-self: end;">2</div>
</div>
 Box 1 is centered due to justify-items: center (applied to the container).

 Box 2 is pushed to the right (end) due to justify-self: end (applied individually).
